            <p>No doubt you may have heard before his philanthropic
            game.</p>

            <p>The lack of oysters pained him much, for how could
            people royster</p>

            <p>And happy be in r-less months without the luscious
            oyster?</p>

            <p>A look of pain was in his face, a pucker on his
            brow,</p>

            <p>Long time he pondered very hard to try and find out
            how.</p>

            <p>At last he cried, "Eureka! from France I'll go and
            bring them,</p>

            <p>And into beds I've got at home without a murmur
            fling them."</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then they came across the Channel, and he very
            sweetly said,</p>

            <p>"So glad to see you looking well, would you like to
            see your bed?</p>

            <p>He wrung his hands and shook his head, and said,
            "Oh, miseree!</p>

            <p>It pains me very deeply, and it drives me to
            distraction,</p>

            <p>You've done what's wrong, and I shall have to
            institute an action."</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then WILLIAMSON, he sobbed aloud, and shed a bitter
            tear,</p>

            <p>"Oh, hang it all," he cried, "why <i>must</i> you
            come and interfere?</p>

            <p>I quite admit, however, that I see your point
            precisely,</p>

            the action nicely."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>They brought that friendly action, and the clever
            counsel tried</p>

            <p>To prove to FAUDELL PHILLIPS that the law was on his
            side.</p>

            <p>But the oyster-dealer found the law for him was one
            too many,</p>

            <p>So he had to pay the piper&mdash;to be quite exact,
            a penny.</p>

    <p><i>Leader</i> (<i>cordially</i>). And now, my dear fellow,
    how are my interests?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>with much heartiness</i>). Getting on
    capitally! Just been writing to all the papers to say that it
    is stupid to call you "Old Dot-and-go-one," because it is
    inapplicable to either your age or your mode of
    controversy.</p>

    <p><i>Lead.</i> (<i>with a feeble smile</i>). That <i>was</i>
    kind of you! But who had said it?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>airily</i>). Oh, someone of about
    fourth-rate importance! and it had been quite forgotten you
    know. So I dragged it up again, and put it all right for
    you.</p>

    <p><i>Lead.</i> (<i>shaking hands</i>). Thanks, so very much.
    But if persons had forgotten it, why revert to it?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> Oh, don't you see? Why, the point is, you are
    not a bit like it-not a scrap like it! Next week I shall write
    and say that it's rubbish to call you a turncoat, because you
    have always been consistent.</p>

    <p><i>Lead.</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). But <i>is</i> anybody
    calling me a turncoat?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> Not that I know of, but they might, don't you
    see. So it's as well to be on the safe side. I shall say that,
    if any one <i>did</i> call you a turncoat, that the speaker
    would prove himself a liar! That ought to give you a leg up,
    oughtn't it?</p>

    <p><i>Lead.</i> (<i>with some hesitation</i>). My dear friend,
    you are <i>most</i> kind; but if you don't mind, I would be so
    immensely obliged if you would leave my interests alone.</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>with great cordiality</i>). What, leave your
    interests alone! Never! You may be always sure of <i>my</i>
    hearty support!</p>

    <p><i>Lead.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). But as a personal matter, I
    must beg of you kindly to leave me alone.</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>reluctantly</i>). Well, of course, if you
    make it a personal matter, I must consent. But the Party will
    suffer.</p>

    <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages some time ago, was there not a
    "Limited Novel Co." of Authors and Artists to produce "Chikkin

        afternoon. A small boat, containing three persons, is just
        visible far out on the glassy grey-green water.</i> BOB

    <p><i>Podbury.</i> Do they look at all as if they meant to come
    in? I tell you what, BOB, vote we row out to them and tell them
    they'll be late for <i>table d'hôte</i>. Eh? [<i>He knocks out
    his pipe.</i></p>

    <p><i>Prendergast</i> (<i>phlegmatically</i>). Only be late for
    it ourselves if we do. They'll come in when they want to.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> It's not safe for your sister,&mdash;I'm hanged
    if it is&mdash;going out in a boat with a duffer like CULCHARD!
    He'll upset her as sure as eggs.</p>

    <p><i>Prend.</i> (<i>with fraternal serenity</i>). With
    pin-oars? Couldn't if he tried! And they've a man with them,
    too. The less I see of that chap CULCHARD the better. I did
    hope we'd choked him off at Nuremberg. I hate the sight of his
    supercilious old mug!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> You can't hate it more than I do&mdash;but what
    can I do? (<i>Pathetically.</i>) I've tried rotting him, but
    somehow he always manages to get the best of it in the end. I
    never saw such a beggar to hang on!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I! <i>I</i> ask him? He settled it all with
    your sister. How could <i>I</i> help it?</p>

    <p><i>Prend.</i> I'd do <i>something</i>. Why can't you tell
    him right out he ain't wanted? <i>I</i> would&mdash;like a
    shot!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> It's not so easy to tell him as you think. We
    haven't been on speaking terms these three days. And, after all
    (<i>feebly</i>) we're supposed to be travelling together, don't
    you know! <i>You</i> might drop him a hint now.</p>

    <p><i>Prend.</i> Don't see how I can very well&mdash;not on my
    own hook. Might lead to ructions with HYPATIA, too.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). BOB, you&mdash;you don't
    think your sister really&mdash;eh?</p>

    <p><i>Prend.</i> HYPATIA's a rum girl&mdash;always was. She
    certainly don't seem to object to your friend CULCHARD. What
    the dickens she can see in him, I don't know!&mdash;but it's no
    use my putting <i>my</i> oar in. She'd only jump on <i>me</i>,

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>rising</i>). Then I <i>must</i>. If that's
    what he's really after, I think I can stop his little game.
    I'll try, at any rate. It's a long worm that has no turning,
    and I've had about enough of it. The first chance I get. I'll
    go for him.</p>

    interesting correspondence on "Our Children's Mouths&mdash;and
    are they widening?" One letter attributes it to the habit of
    thumb&mdash;sucking in infancy&mdash;which certainly ought to
    be checked. Now I never <i>would</i> allow any&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Chaplain's Wife</i>. Nor I. But corals are quite as

    have materially affected the harvest prospects at home; they

    I saw somewhere&mdash;I forget where it was exactly&mdash;a
    suggestion to feed cows on chickweed.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>at the bookcase</i>). Capital thing for

    to know if there's a good doctor here, I suppose? A lady was

    they were in for bad feverish colds or something, and asking
    who there was to call in.</p>

    <p><i>First Old Maid</i>. Nobody told <i>us</i> a word about

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with determination</i>). Look here,
    CULCHARD, I'd just like to know what you mean by the way you're
    going on.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I thought we were both agreed that discussions
    of this kind&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> It's all bosh our travelling together if we're
    not to have any discussions. You've been on the sulk long
    enough. And I'll thank you to inform me what you're after here,
    going about alone with Miss PRENDERGAST like this, in the
    Museum with her all the morning, and on the lake again this
    afternoon,&mdash;it won't <i>do</i>, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If she happens to prefer my society to yours
    and her brother's, I presume you have no claim to
    interfere.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I don't know about that. How about Miss
    TROTTER?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If I remember rightly, you yourself were not
    insensible to Miss TROTTER's&mdash;er&mdash;attractions?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Perhaps not; but I am not engaged to
    her&mdash;you <i>are</i>. You told me so in the train.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You entirely misunderstood me. There was no
    definite understanding between us&mdash;nothing of the sort or
    kind. In fact, it was merely a passing caprice. Since I have
    had the privilege of knowing Miss PRENDERGAST, I see
    clearly&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Then you mean to propose to her, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> That is certainly my intention; have you any
    objection to offer?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Only that I mean to propose too. I daresay my
    chances are as good as yours&mdash;even now.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I doubt it, my dear fellow; however, don't let
    <i>me</i> discourage you.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I don't intend to. (<i>The figure of</i> Miss
    PRENDERGAST <i>is seen to pass the glazed doors, and move
    slowly across the Musik-saal; both rush to the door, and look
    after her.</i>) She's gone out into the balcony. 'Jove, I'll
    go, too, and get it over!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I should not advise you to do so. It is
    possible she may have gone there with
    the&mdash;er&mdash;expectation of being joined by&mdash;by
    somebody else. [<i>He smiles complacently.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> You mean she gave you a <i>rendezvous</i>
    there? I don't believe it!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I did not say so. But I am not prepared to
    deny that I have been waiting here with some such
    expectation.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>holding the door</i>). If you go, I go
    too&mdash;that's all.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Don't be absurd. You will only be <i>de
    trop</i>, I assure you.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> <i>De trop</i> or not, I mean going&mdash;she
    shall choose between us.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>turning pale</i>). I suppose you intend to
    enlighten her as to my&mdash;er&mdash;little flirtation (before
    I knew <i>her</i>) with Miss TROTTER? Do it, PODBURY, do
    it&mdash;if you think you'll gain any good by
    it!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Telling tales is not exactly in my line. But
    you don't go on that balcony without me&mdash;that's all.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, listen to reason, my dear fellow. What
    you propose is ridiculous. I&mdash;I don't mind conceding this:
    we'll each go, and&mdash;er tit up, as you call it, which goes
    first.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Done with you! (<i>Produces a mark.</i>) Sudden

    (<i>Tosses.</i>) Eagle! Confound you! But I mean to have my
    innings all the same.</p>

    <h3>VI.&mdash;BUDWELL'S REVENGE.</h3>

    <p>My friend, THOMAS GIDLING, is something indefinite and
    authoritative in the Post Office. He is a practical man. He can
    do fretwork, cook a steak, clean boots, find out what's wrong
    with the gas, and understand Waterloo Station; in an emergency
    he is invaluable. This is just as well, because destiny has
    decided that the life of THOMAS GIDLING shall be a series of
    emergencies. He has comfortable bachelor quarters at the very
    top of Parkington Chambers, which are situated in
    Bloomsbury.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/173-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/173-1.png"
             alt="Budwell's Revenge." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>One night last winter I had been dining with GIDLING at his
    Club; after dinner he proposed that we should go round to his
    flat for a talk and a smoke. GIDLING, being practical, can make
    coffee, which is a thing that they cannot do at GIDLING's Club,
    nor, indeed, at many others. So I consented.</p>

    <p>We had climbed painfully to the top of Parkington Chambers,
    and had just got inside GIDLING's outer door, when we noticed a
    very marked and curious smell. "There's something wrong about
    this," remarked GIDLING, severely. I agreed with him, adding,
    out of a nervous politeness, from which I suffer sometimes,
    that I rather liked the smell, "Then you're an idiot," said
    GIDLING, who never suffers from politeness at all. He opened
    the door of his sitting-room, and then we saw at once what was
    the matter. The lower part of the chimney was on fire; the
    fire-place was covered with glowing masses of soot which had
    fallen. "HANKIN's had another nasty touch of that influenza,"
    remarked GIDLING. HANKIN is GIDLING's servant, and at regular
    intervals becomes incapacitated for work. HANKIN himself says
    that it is influenza, and speaks of "another of them relapses;"
    GIDLING thinks that it is as a rule intoxication. As a matter
    of fact HANKIN would not be a bad servant if his zeal was
    distributed over him rather more evenly. It is always either
    excessive or defective. It comes out in lumps. In neglecting to
    have the chimney swept HANKIN had shown defect; in the way that
    he had piled up the fire he had shown excess. In subsequently
    absenting himself from the flat he had shown a certain amount
    of wisdom, for GIDLING was rather angry.</p>

    <p>"Not but what I can put it all right," said GIDLING. "I'm a
    practical man. Fire Brigade? I thought you'd suggest a few fire
    brigades. No, not exactly. I'll show you how to stop a thing of
    this kind." He went into his bed-room, and returned with the
    water-jug. An iron ladder from the main staircase led through a
    trap-door in the roof. GIDLING went up this ladder with the
    water-jug, while I waited to see the result in the
    sitting-room, I could hear him walking about on the roof, and I
    looked out for a deluge of water to descend down the chimney
    into the fire-place. But no deluge came. Presently GIDLING
    descended and entered the room with the empty water-jug.</p>

    <p>"Did it splash much?" he asked. "No, there was no water came
    down at all."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Then I've emptied this water-jug down the wrong
    chimney. We'd better clear out of this."</p>

    <p>At this juncture HANKIN returned, and GIDLING said a good
    deal to him. HANKIN was left to put out the fire, and we went
    back again to the Club. GIDLING seemed rather annoyed with me
    for laughing about his mistake.</p>

    <p>"It's a deuced awkward thing," he said. "That water went
    down somebody's chimney, and it's put somebody's fire out. That
    means unpleasantness, you know, if he or she finds out who did
    it."</p>

    <p>"Who live in the flats below yours?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"An Art-student and her mother in the flat below
    mine&mdash;they are really most charming people, and I hope to
    goodness it wasn't their chimney that I poured the water down.
    I'm on rather friendly terms with them. Then on the first floor
    there's BUDWELL. He's a conceited affected ape. I only hope it
    was he who got the benefit of that water-jug. It's rather
    amusing, you know. BUDWELL's very much in love with Miss VANE
    (that's the Art-student), and she loathes him&mdash;at least I
    believe so. Poor beggar!" GIDLING laughed, sarcastically. "Yes,
    I hope that was BUDWELL's chimney, not the other."</p>

    <p>It turned out afterwards that it <i>was</i> BUDWELL's
    chimney, and he found out that it was GIDLING who had done the
    deed. So BUDWELL determined on revenge. He climbed up on to the
    roof with a large bath-can of water, intending to empty it down
    GIDLING's chimney. Chimneys ought to be labelled. The whole of
    the contents of that can descended into Mrs. VANE's fireplace.
    BUDWELL called and apologised, but it was of no use. They
    considered it mean of BUDWELL to take revenge for what was only
    a mistake on GIDLING's part; and they were not very well
    pleased at having their own fire put out. "A chimney's not the
    place for a cataract, you know, Mr. BUDWELL," said Miss
    VANE.</p>

    <p>BUDWELL went back to his own flat and brooded over his
    misfortunes. He had now grown still more angry with GIDLING,
    which was irrational of him; and he determined to take a still
    fiercer revenge. Late at night he conveyed the bath-can and
    several jugs, all full of water, on to the roof. There was no
    fear of his selecting Mrs. VANE's chimney by mistake this time.
    One by one he emptied the jugs and the water-can, and then
    descended to his own flat, fiendishly triumphant, as he thought
    of the havoc he must have made in GIDLING's fire-place.</p>

    <p>But when he got to his own flat, he found that he had
    emptied all that water down his own chimney.</p>

    <p>After that he gave up his revenges, together with his
    affections and his apartments. But GIDLING tells the story with
    considerable unction; the facts of it were partly derived from
    BUDWELL's servant and partly from Miss VANE&mdash;with whom
    GIDLING is beginning to be on more than friendly terms.</p>

    <h2>INTERNATIONAL NURSERY-TALE CONGRESS.</h2>

    <p>The Chair was taken by Mr. JOHN HORNER, P.R.I.N.T.C., lineal
    descendant of the celebrated "Jack" of that ilk.</p>

    <p>The President said he had no desire to waste the meeting's
    valuable time. He would at once address himself (and the
    company present) to the myth, if myth it could be called, which
    had immortalised his own name. Need he say he alluded to the
    legend of "Little Jack Horner"? (<i>Cheers.</i>) Some
    commentators are of opinion that "HORNER." was a typographical
    error for "HOMER." But the prefix; and the epithet combined to
    militate against this ingenious and plausible, but specious,
    theory. "HOMER" was not in any sense "Little," nor was his
    Pagan name "JACK." Again, "Corner," in the second line, could
    not in any language have ever rhymed with "HOMER." He knew that
    "Cromer" furnished them with a rhyme for "HOMER;" but if this
    were accepted, what became of the ancient Greek, of the Syriac,
    of the Phoenician, of the Nimrodic legends, nay, of the very
    <i>Iliad</i> itself, if "HOMER" were a native of "Cromer"?
    (<i>Loud and prolonged cheers.</i>) No! "Jack Horner," or, as
    it was originally written, "Jakorna," was of Scandinavian
    origin, and it was, in all probability, a mythmic
    rhyth&mdash;No, beg pardon, he should say a rhythmic myth
    (<i>Cheers</i>) sung by a wandering Sam Oar Troupe on their
    visiting Egypt and the Provinces before the time of the
    Celtic-Phoenician O'SIRIS, or at least before the reign of
    RAMESES THE FIRST, ancestor of the great Scotch RAMSEY
    family&mdash;(<i>Cheers</i>)&mdash;at one of the social
    entertainments given on a non-hunting day by that eminent
    sportsman NIMROD. Then came the question of where was "the
    corner" in which Jakorna secluded himself? Of course,
    Christmas, as differentiating this pie from all others, was a
    modern substitution. The original word was probably "Kosmik."

    have been! Probably of Hibernian origin, as among
    conversational sparklers there are few on record more brilliant
    than "Irish Diamonds." Stay, though! If the real diamonds were
    "turned out of the chemist's retorts," then his retorts,
    without these flashes of brilliancy, must have been a trifle
    dull, and he is no longer the chemist we took him for. "But,"

    <p>"Respected ANDREW LANG," writes the Baron's Assistant

    It's an ugly piece of bludgeon work, I admit, but not
    convincing to anyone who has read the book of which you speak.
    You tear away a line or two from the context, and ask your
    readers to say if <i>that</i> is wit or humour. How your
    admirers would have protested had any sacrilegious critic
    ventured to treat one of your own immortal works in this
    manner. <i>Essays in Little</i>, a book which, by the way,
    appeared in the same series for which Mr. BARRY PAIN wrote, is
    a pleasant and inoffensive compilation, but even <i>Essays in
    Little</i> would have presented a sorry appearance if, let us
    say, ANDREW LANG had reviewed it in this perfunctory and
    extractory and arbitrary fashion. I remember that in that case
    the critics were respectfully enthusiastic. Even Mr. BLUDYER
    would have doffed his cap, I fancy, to one</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>For, after all, you stand high in the journalistic world.
    Your opinion passes current in many a select circle. Not even
    your vagaries seem to have power to offend the worshippers to
    whom your word has long been a law, whether you spoke of golf,
    of salmon, of folk-lore or of books. The censure of a BLUDYER
    (I wonder what has brought that formidable name to my mind) can
    do little to discourage you. But Mr. BARRY PAIN is a young
    writer. And yet some one remarked that <i>In a Canadian
    Canoe</i> was better even than <i>Essays in Little</i>, and the
    audacious words were actually printed in a journal to which
    ANDREW LANG is an occasional contributor. I myself have never
    dared to go so far. There is something sacred about an
    established reputation. And I can honestly say that I like the
    elegant airy trifles which your little Muse has bestowed upon
    us, though I confess to a weariness when the talk is too much
    of golf-clubs and salmon rods. And I admire your appreciation
    of the original work of other men. In the present case you and
    I disagree upon a question of taste. That is all. <i>Tant pis
    pour moi</i>, I hasten to add. But I disagree in good company,
    for I note with some amusement, that the PAYN whom you rightly
    praise, has a kind and encouraging word for the PAIN whom you
    so vehemently disparage. And in this case I will stake my all
    upon the eulogy of JAMES PAYN as against the censure of ANDREW
    LANG. As you did me the honour to refer to something I had

    <h2>JOURNAL OF A ROLLING STONE.</h2>

    <h3>TENTH ENTRY.</h3>

    <p>DICK FIBBINS, my more or less "learned" instructor in
    practical law, goes out to a good many evening parties, I find.
    Casually remarks that he "danced three square dances, the other
    night, with old DAVIS's ugly daughter, the Solor (legal slang
    for Solicitor), in Caraway Street." It's DAVIS himself, not the
    daughter, that is the Solicitor, and, it seems she introduced
    the gay FIBBINS to her Papa. Hence another brief, a rather
    complicated one, on some dispute about a mortgage.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:37%;">
        <a href="images/180-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/180-1.png"
             alt="'Old Proser.'" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>On the morning when the case is to come into Court, DICK the
    Brief-hunter, who has promised to take me there, seems nervous.
    Yet he is still confident that, if "old PROSER" is the judge,
    he will "pull the thing off." It will be, apparently, a case of
    "Pull FIBBINS, pull PROSER."</p>

    <p>In Court I occupy a seat just behind him, because&mdash;as
    he observes&mdash;I've been "grinding away at the case, and
    know the subject down to the ground"&mdash;which I don't think
    <i>he</i> does. I therefore am to act as his reserves, also as
    his prompter, and to supply him with the names of cases which
    he has forgotten, and which he wishes to quote. Rather a
    responsible position. Should feel more confidence in result if
    FIBBINS had told me of this prompter arrangement before the
    very morning when the trial comes on.</p>

    <p>"Old PROSER," appears to my untutored gaze to be rather a
    dignified occupant of the Bench. I don't know whether he
    cherishes any personal or professional animosity against DICK
    FIBBINS, but directly the latter opens his mouth to begin,
    PROSER seems inclined to jump down it.</p>

    <p>"A complicated case of foreclosure?" he growls. "You needn't
    tell us that. All foreclosure cases are complicated. <i>I</i>
    ever saw one yet that wasn't."</p>

    <p>FIBBINS goes along unimpeded for a minute or two, PROSER
    having thrown himself back with an air of resigned inattention,
    one of the other Judges taking furtive notes, and the third
    resting his elbows on his desk, and his head on his elbows, and
    eyeing <i>me</i> with a stony and meaningless stare. Can he
    suddenly have gone mad?</p>

    <p>I have no time to consider this interesting point, as
    FIBBINS is again in difficulties about some precedent that he
    wants to quote, but which he has forgotten, and turns sharply
    round on me, saying, in a fierce whisper&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What the doose <i>is</i> that case?"</p>

    <p>I look hurriedly down on the sheet of paper on which (as I
    fancy) I have jotted down the authorities bearing on the
    subject, and reply, also in a whisper&mdash;"<i>Cookson and
    Gedge</i>."</p>

    <p>"The Court, m'luds," FIBBINS airily proceeds, as if he were
    indebted entirely to his own memory for the information, "held
    in <i>Cookson and Gedge</i> that a mortgagor who desires to
    foreclose&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Where is the case you mention?" suddenly asks the Judge who
    was staring at me a moment ago. He is now engaged in first
    looking at my instructor suspiciously, and then at me, as if he
    thought that there was some horrible secret between us, which
    he is determined to probe to the bottom.</p>

    <p>"Volume Six of the <i>Law Reports</i>, m'lud."</p>

    <p>"Page?" snaps PROSER.</p>

    <p>"Page 184, m'lud. As I was saying, the Court there held that
    the right to foreclose at any reasonable time is not taken
    away&mdash;"</p>

    <p>This time the interruption comes from the Judge who I
    thought was going mad, but who now seems to be preternaturally
    and offensively sane.</p>

    <p>"It would be odd," he observes, cuttingly, "if any Court
    <i>had</i> decided a point about mortgages in <i>Cookson versus
    Gedge</i>, because on looking at the page to which you have
    referred us, find that <i>Cookson and Gedge</i> was <i>a
    running-down case</i>!"</p>

    <p>I glance at the paper before me in consternation; another
    moment, and the horrifying fact is revealed to me that the
    sheet of "authorities" I have brought with me bears, not on the
    mortgage case now before the Court, but on that previous
    six-guinea matter on which I had given ROGERS &amp; Co. my
    valuable Opinion gratis.</p>

    <p>I hear DICK FIBBINS, in this trying position, with the eyes
    of three Judges fixed on him, swearing at me under his breath
    in the most awful manner. But why did he depend on <i>me</i>?
    Why didn't he get up the case himself?</p>

    <p>Deprived at one blow of most of his precedents,
    "shorn"&mdash;as the Breach of Promise Reports puts
    it&mdash;"of its usual attractions," FIBBINS's speech becomes
    an impotent affair. He has to quote such cases as he can
    remember, and as neither his memory nor his legal knowledge is
    great, he presents them all wrongly, and prematurely sits down.
    I see PROSER's wrinkled countenance illumined with an exultant
    smile. Just as I am moving out of Court (FIBBINS has to "move"
    <i>in</i> Court), because I am desirous of avoiding FIBBINS's
    wrath,&mdash;though I feel that this <i>fiasco</i> is more his
    fault than mine,&mdash;I hear the presiding judge (the mad one)
    say to the Defendant's Counsel that he need not trouble to
    address them. I know what <i>that</i> means&mdash;judgment for
    the Defendant!</p>

    <p>Chancing half-an-hour later to enter a Strand Restaurant,
    part of which, I regret to say, is also a drinking-bar, I am
    startled at beholding the identical form and features of
    FIBBINS himself. He appears flushed&mdash;has two companions
    with him, to whom he is talking excitedly. I hear the
    words&mdash;"idiot"&mdash;"jackass of a pupil"&mdash;"regular
    sell"&mdash;and; but no, perhaps I had better not repeat all
    that I <i>did</i> hear. I decide to seek refreshment
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Over the subsequent scene in FIBBINS's Chambers I prefer to
    draw a veil. It is sufficient to say that I was obliged to
    leave FIBBINS, and thereafter received a solid half-year's
    instruction in the Chambers of a learned Counsel who was not a
    briefless impostor.</p>

    <p>I heard afterwards that he had added the story to his fund
    of legal dining-out anecdotes, and had considerably amplified
    it. It came out in a shape which made FIBBINS a hero, myself an
    imbecile of a rather malicious kind, PROSER helplessly cowering
    under FIBBINS's wealth of arguments, and the other two Judges
    reduced to admiring silence. I take this opportunity of stating
    that if anybody "cowered" in Court on that memorable occasion,
    it was certainly not poor old PROSER.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
